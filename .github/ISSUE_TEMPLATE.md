### DO NOT IGNORE ###

If you have not submitted a GitHub Issue to lmfit before, please read
[this](https://github.com/lmfit/lmfit-py/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

In short, it says: ***do NOT use GitHub Issues for questions, it is only for bugs!***

We are happy to help, but please use the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/lmfit-py)

as a Github Issue anyway, your Issue will be closed and not answered.

However, if you discovered a bug, please proceed and provide ALL the following information:

#### Description
<!-- Provide a short description of the issue, describe the expected outcome, and show
        the actual result including the full traceback if applicable -->


###### Version information
<!-- Generate version information with this command in the Python shell and copy the output here:
import sys, lmfit, numpy, scipy, asteval, uncertainties, six
print('Python: {}\n\nlmfit: {}, scipy: {}, numpy: {}, asteval: {}, uncertainties: {}, six: {}'\
      .format(sys.version, lmfit.__version__, scipy.__version__, numpy.__version__, \
      asteval.__version__, uncertainties.__version__, six.__version__))
 -->
